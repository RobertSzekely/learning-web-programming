The assigment:
Write a web page which contains a div with a background image. When the mouse is over the div, the background image should change.
Write a web page which contains a menu with five text items stacked vertically, one on top of each other. 
In the beginning all text items are blurred. When the mouse is over an item, it grows larger and becomes clear (unblurred) so that it is emphasized with respect to the other items.
